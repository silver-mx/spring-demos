### JWT-Spring Cloud Gateway Demo

This is a demo that uses Spring Cloud Gateway to authenticate requests via JWT.

The demo is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQfaExykbU, and on Dan Vega's tutorial https://www.danvega.dev/blog/2022/09/06/spring-security-jwt/ but this version uses instead the latest SpringBoot/Spring Cloud version at the moment (Dec/2023) and adds some modifications.

The demo uses:
 * Discovery service (Netflix-Eureka)
 * Config Server
 * Authentication service
 * Spring Cloud Gateway
