### JWT-Spring Cloud Gateway Demo

This is a demo that uses Spring Cloud Gateway to authenticate requests via JWT.

The demo is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAQfaExykbU, but this version uses instead the latest SpringBoot/Spring Cloud version at the moment (Dec/2023).

The demo uses:
 * Discovery service (Netflix-Eureka)
 * Config Server
 * Authentication service
